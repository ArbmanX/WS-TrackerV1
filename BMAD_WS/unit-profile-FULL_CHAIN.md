# Unit Profile: FULL_CHAIN

> Generated by the Unit Deep-Dive workflow on 2026-02-17

## Table Overview

The unit chain is a 4-table hierarchy linked by the composite key **JOBGUID + STATNAME + SEQUENCE**:

| Table | Role | Key Relationship |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| **SSUNITS** | Parent — core unit record holding status, acceptance flags, and sign-off fields | Primary: JOBGUID + STATNAME + SEQUENCE |
| **VEGUNIT** | Child — vegetation work details: species, actions, measurements, quantities | FK → SSUNITS via composite key |
| **JOBVEGETATIONUNITS** | Child — job-specific vegetation assignments linking units to job-level veg config | FK → SSUNITS via composite key |
| **SSUNITSCSTM** | Child — custom fields for deployment-specific extensions (PPL-specific columns) | FK → SSUNITS via composite key |

**SSUNITS** is the anchor. Every unit row in the system lives here first, and the three child tables extend it with vegetation work data (VEGUNIT), job-level veg assignments (JOBVEGETATIONUNITS), and custom overrides (SSUNITSCSTM). Not every SSUNITS row has children in all three — the population gaps are part of what this deep-dive will surface.

**Investigation resolved:** 66 of 96 UNIT codes appear in VEGUNIT but not SSUNITSCSTM — these are non-Dx job unit codes. SSUNITSCSTM is Dx-exclusive (see SSUNITSCSTM Correlation section).

## Schema Fields

### Field Counts
| Table | Fields | Unique (non-chain) | Date Fields |
|-------|--------|-------------------|-------------|
| SSUNITS | 32 | 24 | 1 (EDITDATE OLE) |
| VEGUNIT | 227 | 219 | 19 (16 ftDate, 3 ftDateTime/OLE) |
| JOBVEGETATIONUNITS | 17 | 9 | 1 (EDITDATE OLE) |
| SSUNITSCSTM | 14 | 6 | 2 (TARGETEDCOMP + EDITDATE OLE) |

### Composite Key (shared by all 4 tables)
`JOBGUID + STATNAME + SEQUENCE` — 1:1 relationship from each child to SSUNITS.

Additional chain fields on all 4: `UNITGUID`, `WO`, `EXT`, `UNIT`, `EDITDATE`

### SSUNITS (32 fields) — Parent
Core unit record: status (N/E/R), quantity, wire/pole/neutral/misc variants with manual override flags, geometry blob, annotation offsets, parent unit linkage (PUNITGUID, PSEQID).

**Indexes (5):** WOEXTSTAT, WO, JOBGUID, JGUIDSTAT, WOEXT
**Parents:** STATIONS (JOBGUID+STATNAME), UNITS (UNIT), SS (JOBGUID)
**Children (10):** VEGUNIT, JOBVEGETATIONUNITS, SSUNITSCSTM, SSCLUNIT, SSCNTSEC, DMGUNIT, GIOUNIT, JOBEXPCLEARANCEUNITS, JOBEXPCANOPYUNITS

### VEGUNIT (227 fields) — Vegetation Details
Assessment, permissioning, crew/work, customer/owner, herbicide (4 trade names with quantities), species/tree, audit/QC, removal, geo/infrastructure, 8 signature blobs.

**Indexes (5):** JOBGUID, WOEXT, WO, JGUIDSTAT, WOEXTSTAT
**Parents:** SS, STATIONS, SSUNITS

### JOBVEGETATIONUNITS (17 fields) — Work Measurements
AREA (sq meters), ACRES, NUMTREES, WIDTHWRK, LENGTHWRK, MANHOURS, plus CALC* booleans for auto-calculated values.

**Indexes (7):** WES, WO, JOBGUID, JGS, WOEXT, JGUIDSTAT, WOEXTSTAT
**Parents:** SSUNITS (composite key), SS, STATIONS

### SSUNITSCSTM (14 fields) — Custom Extensions
GROUPASSIGNEDTO (CSV crew list), GROUPASSIGNEDTO_USERS (CSV usernames), COPYUNITSGUID (sync linked units), ESTUNITCOST, TMREASON, TARGETEDCOMP.

**Indexes (5):** JOBGUID, WOEXT, WO, JGUIDSTAT, WOEXTSTAT
**Parents:** SS, STATIONS, SSUNITS

### Date Fields (23 total)
19 on VEGUNIT alone. Key investigation targets for step 3:
- Which have real dates vs. OLE epoch 1899 defaults?
- Do EDITDATE values match across all 4 tables for same unit row?
- Correlation between ACCDATE, CREW_DATE, DATEPOP, ASSDDATE?

### Investigation Queue (all resolved)
1. ~~Which UNIT values appear in VEGUNIT but not SSUNITSCSTM?~~ → **66 codes** — non-Dx unit types (see SSUNITSCSTM Correlation)
2. ~~Date field population rates?~~ → 6 ALIVE, 6 LOW, 7 DEAD of 19 VEGUNIT dates (see Date Field Populations)
3. ~~EDITDATE synchronization?~~ → Identical across all 4 tables — server sets at SENDJOB (see EDITDATE Propagation)

## Live Data Populations

### Row Counts
| Table | Rows | Coverage |
|-------|------|---------|
| SSUNITS | 3,654,364 | 100% baseline |
| VEGUNIT | 3,654,488 | ~100% |
| JOBVEGETATIONUNITS | 3,654,490 | ~100% |
| SSUNITSCSTM | 109,567 | **3%** — sparse |

### Key Populations
- SSUNITS: UNITTYPE/STATUS/UNIT/OBJECTID (100%), GEOMETRY (99.97%), QUANTITY (99.8%), POLEVAR (74%)
- VEGUNIT: FORESTER/ASSDDATE (99.7%), CONTRACTOR (96.4%), GF/GF_USER (34.9%), CREW_DATE (33.5%)
- JVU: NUMTREES (29%), ACRES (23%), AREA (22%), MANHOURS (0%)
- SSUNITSCSTM: All custom fields effectively dead (max 91 rows = 0.08%)

### EDITDATE Propagation
Server applies identical EDITDATE timestamp across all tables in the job graph during SENDJOB. Cannot determine which table was edited — only when job was last saved.

### VEGUNIT Date Field Populations (live query 2026-02-17)
| Date Field | Populated | % | Status | Lifecycle Stage |
|-----------|-----------|---|--------|----------------|
| EDITDATE | 3,655,765 | 100% | ALIVE | Job save (OLE float) |

### UNIT_CLASS Full Distribution (live query 2026-02-18)
| UNIT_CLASS | Count | % | CUSTOMSTATUS Mirror | Meaning |
|-----------|-------|---|-------------------|---------|
| NULL | 238 | <0.01% | empty | Uninitialized — skeleton rows |
| 0 | 72,844 | 2.0% | mixed (ACTIV 88%) | **Complete** — assessment done or work finished |
| 1 | 1,227,928 | 33.6% | ACTIV (97.8%) | **Estimated/Working** — active work pipeline |
| 2 | 1,081,078 | 29.6% | SA (99.9%) | **Sent to Assessment** — dispatched for field inventory |
| 3 | 5,105 | 0.14% | SA (99.2%) | **Permissioning Exception** — Refused/No Contact/stalled |
| 4 | 1,268,572 | 34.7% | CLOSE (99.8%) | **Closed/Archived** — terminal state |

**Note:** CDB files only reference values 0, 1, 2. Values 3 and 4 are server-managed states invisible to mobile forms.

### UNIT_CLASS=3 Breakdown (Permissioning Exception)
100% assessment-type jobs (zero on Work jobs):
| JOBTYPE | Refused | No Contact | Approved | PPL Approved |
|---------|---------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Assessment Dx | 2,498 | 586 | 656 | 10 |
| Split_Assessment | 975 | — | 11 | 3 |
| Tandem_Assessment | 335 | 31 | — | — |
| **Total** | **3,808 (74.6%)** | **617 (12.1%)** | **667 (13.1%)** | **13 (0.3%)** |

667 "Approved" units at CLASS=3 suggest resolved permissions where the class was never updated back — a data quality gap.

### CUSTOMSTATUS Distribution (live query 2026-02-18)
| CUSTOMSTATUS | Count | % | UNIT_CLASS Mirror | Role |
|-------------|-------|---|------------------|------|
| CLOSE | 1,268,702 | 34.7% | 4 (99.8%) | Unit archived |
| ACTIV | 1,267,943 | 34.7% | 1 (94.7%) | Unit being worked |
| SA | 1,099,622 | 30.1% | 2 (98.3%) | Sent to assessment |
| empty | 19,498 | 0.5% | mixed | Unset |

CUSTOMSTATUS and UNIT_CLASS are dual-tracked — integer for CDB SQL views, string for display/reporting.

### PERMSTAT Distribution (live query 2026-02-18)
| PERMSTAT | Count | % | Notes |
|---------|-------|---|-------|
| Approved | 2,657,017 | 72.7% | Owner granted access |
| (empty) | 890,398 | 24.4% | Not yet permissioned |
| PPL Approved | 95,697 | 2.6% | Utility-approved (no owner contact needed) |
| No Contact | 6,909 | 0.19% | Could not reach owner |
| Refused | 4,106 | 0.11% | Owner denied access |
| Deferred | 1,638 | 0.04% | Permissioning postponed |

**6 values total** — config only lists 3 (Approved, PPL Approved, Refused). "No Contact" and "Deferred" are undocumented.

### SS.STATUS → CUSTOMSTATUS Independence (live query 2026-02-18)
CUSTOMSTATUS is NOT inherited from SS.STATUS. A closed job (SS.STATUS=CLOSE) contains units at all three CUSTOMSTATUS values:
| SS.STATUS | CLOSE units | ACTIV units | SA units |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| CLOSE | 1,216,311 | 1,183,282 | 979,259 |
| ACTIV | 11,266 | 34,438 | 55,450 |
| QC | 40,265 | 8,066 | 53,099 |
| SA | — | 29,286 | 5 |
| DEF | 768 | 5,510 | 11,693 |
| REWRK | 2 | 6,065 | 78 |
| REV | 2 | 1,296 | 6 |

SS.STATUS tracks job lifecycle (7 values: CLOSE, ACTIV, QC, SA, DEF, REWRK, REV). CUSTOMSTATUS tracks unit lifecycle within the job.

### Two-Pipeline Lifecycle Model
```
ASSESSMENT PIPELINE:                    WORK PIPELINE:
  NULL → 0 → 2 → 4                       1 → 0
  (init) (complete) (dispatched) (closed)  (estimated) (work complete)
              ↘ 3 (perm exception — dead end)
```
- Assessment: units are created (0=complete assessment), dispatched to work (2=SA), then archived (4=CLOSE). Permissioning failures → class 3.
- Work: units arrive as estimated (1=ACTIV), crew completes work → class 0 again.

### UNIT_CLASS vs Date Presence
- CLASS 0 (complete): ASSDDATE+DATEPOP+NOTIFDATE+DUEDATE present, no CREW_DATE (assessment) OR all dates present (work)
- CLASS 1 (estimated/worked): All above + CREW_DATE, sometimes AUDITDATE
- CLASS 2 (dispatched): Assessment dates only
- CLASS 3 (perm exception): Assessment dates + REFDATE (0.08%) or NOTIFDATE, no work dates
- CLASS 4 (closed/archived): Frozen snapshot — dates reflect state at closure

### SSUNITS.STATUS — Origin Flag (live query 2026-02-18)
| Value | Count | % | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---|---------|
| E | 3,318,540 | 90.8% | Existing — unit from original assessment |
| A | 338,193 | 9.2% | Added — discovered by crew during field work |

Only 2 values in production. This is NOT a lifecycle status — it's an origin flag ("how did this unit enter the system?").

### SS.STATUS — Job-Level Status Vocabulary (live query 2026-02-18)
15+ values, segmented by job type family:

**Dx Pipeline (Assessment Dx, Work Dx, Split, Tandem):**
CLOSE → ACTIV → QC → SA → DEF → REWRK → REV

**Cycle Maintenance (Trim, Herbicide):**
NRS → ACTIV → A → S8 → S9 → READY → DEF

**Other (Scenarios, Weekly, Unit Based):**
APV → ACTIV → SZ → NEW → NACTV → CANCL → PTNEW

Top job counts: Work Dx CLOSE (19,055), Unit Based APV (18,099), Cycle Maintenance NRS (6,440).

### EXT Naming Conventions (live query 2026-02-18)
| JOBTYPE | EXT Pattern | Example | Meaning |
|---------|------------|---------|---------|
| Assessment Dx | `@` | `@` | Parent assessment (template) |
| Work Dx | `N` or `N_N` | `1`, `1_1`, `2_13` | Crew number + visit sequence |
| Work Dx | `@N` or `@N_N` | `@1`, `@1_3` | Parent template for crew N |
| Split_Assessment | `C_x` | `C_a`, `C_ba` | Contractor letter split |
| Tandem_Assessment | `Copy` | `Copy` | Duplicate for parallel assessment |

Work Dx EXT goes up to `1_51` (crew 1 had 51 work visits to the same station) and `@1_8`. Crew numbering reaches at least 6 (`6` = 2,105 units).

## CDV Form References

### Forms at SSUNITS Level
| Form | Target Table | Key Fields | Event Scripts |
|------|-------------|------------|---------------|
| VegUnit.cdv | VEGUNIT | ACCEPTANCEYN, ACCDATE, ASSNOTE, FORESACCEP_SIGA | `SSUNITS_ACCEPTANCEYN_OnChange2` |
| VegUnit_X.cdv | VEGUNIT | Same + POWNACCEP_SIGA | Same OnChange |
| Acceptance.cdv | VEGUNIT | clearveg, CONSENTCOMMENTS, sigfield, remtree, stumpherb | None |
| Refusal.cdv | VEGUNIT | sigfield, REFOWNER | None |

### Tables with No CDV Form
- **SSUNITSCSTM** — server creates skeleton records only
- **JOBVEGETATIONUNITS** — server calculates from geometry (LENGTH/WIDTH editable via VegStation)

### Configuration Drift
| Field | Defined In | Populated? | Issue |
|-------|-----------|------------|-------|
| SSUNITSCSTM.GROUPASSIGNEDTO | GenericUnits.cdb | 0% | Feature works at job level (SSCUSTOM), never at unit level |
| SSUNITSCSTM.COPYUNITSGUID | GenericUnits.cdb | 0% | Copy-sync feature never deployed |
| JVU.MANHOURS | CDB views query it | 0% | Referenced in SQL but never populated |
| VEGUNIT.CREWNOTES | CDB views query it | 0% | Referenced in SQL but never written |

## CDB SQL Usage

### References per Table
| Table | CDB Files | Most Important |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| SSUNITS | 7 | worktoassign (OBJECTID, GEOMETRY, UNITTYPE), V_Work/V_Assessment (UNIT, QUANTITY) |
| VEGUNIT | 6 | worktoassign (primary table, UNIT_CLASS=2), worktocomplete (UNIT_CLASS=0) |
| JVU | 5 | CP_Units (`Coalesce(Area, NumTrees, LengthWrk) as Quantity`), worktoassign (measurements) |
| SSUNITSCSTM | **0** | **Never queried by any CDB view** |

### UNIT_CLASS Semantics (CDB analysis + live discovery)
CDB files reference 3 values; live data reveals 5 + NULL:
- NULL = uninitialized skeleton (238 rows)
- 0 = complete — assessment done OR work finished (72,844 rows, CDB: worktocomplete.cdb)
- 1 = estimated/working — active work pipeline (1,227,928 rows, CDB: EstimatedUnitCost2.cdb)
- 2 = dispatched — sent to assessment (1,081,078 rows, CDB: worktoassign.cdb)
- 3 = permissioning exception — refused/no contact (5,105 rows, **no CDB reference**)
- 4 = closed/archived — terminal state (1,268,572 rows, **no CDB reference**)

### Canonical 7-Table Join (worktoassign.cdb)
```
VEGUNIT → VEGSTAT → UNITS → JOBVEGETATIONUNITS → SSUNITS → SS → VEGJOB
```
SSUNITSCSTM is never part of any canonical join.

## JOBTYPE Taxonomy (live query 2026-02-18)

Jobs span 16 types across 4 families:

| Family | Job Types | Job Count | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| **Dx Pipeline** | Assessment Dx, Work Dx, Split_Assessment, Tandem_Assessment | ~22,500 | Core vegetation workflow — 95%+ of unit rows |
| **Cycle Maintenance** | Trim, Herbicide | ~9,400 | Scheduled maintenance cycles |
| **Program** | Scenarios, Weekly, Unit Based, WorkPlanner Program, Reactive | ~20,500 | Planning/tracking |
| **Administrative** | Special Projects, Capital Projects, Contractor Payroll, Budget Forecast, Job, Pole Review, Damage Assessment | ~3,200 | Misc |

The Dx Pipeline produces the vast majority of VEGUNIT/SSUNITS/JVU rows. All SSUNITSCSTM rows are Dx-exclusive.

## SSUNITSCSTM Correlation (live query 2026-02-18)

### Dx-Exclusive Table
SSUNITSCSTM rows exist **only** on Dx-pipeline job types (NON_DX_ROWS = 0):
- Assessment Dx, Work Dx, Split_Assessment — 100% of 109,567 rows
- The server creates skeleton rows for every unit on Dx jobs, regardless of whether custom fields are populated

### UNIT Codes: VEGUNIT vs SSUNITSCSTM
- **96 UNIT codes** appear in VEGUNIT
- **30 UNIT codes** appear in SSUNITSCSTM
- **66 UNIT codes** appear in VEGUNIT but NOT in SSUNITSCSTM — these are non-Dx job unit codes
- The 30 codes present in SSUNITSCSTM are the work unit types used on Dx-pipeline assessment jobs

### Verdict
SSUNITSCSTM is not "dead" — it's **scoped**. The table itself has 100% coverage within the Dx pipeline. However, the custom fields within it (GROUPASSIGNEDTO, COPYUNITSGUID, ESTUNITCOST, TMREASON, TARGETEDCOMP) are all effectively unused (<0.1% populated).

## Dead Field Report

**20 confirmed dead fields** across 4 tables (SSUNITSCSTM custom fields dead, but table itself is Dx-scoped):

### Deployment-Specific Dead (4 fields)
Engineering/staking fields in a vegetation-only deployment.
| Field | Table | Evidence |
|-------|-------|---------|
| WIRESIZE | SSUNITS | 0%, no CDV, no CDB |
| WIREVAR | SSUNITS | <0.01% (10 rows), no CDV, no CDB |
| DRAWTYPE | SSUNITS | 0%, no CDV, no CDB |
| PUNITGUID | SSUNITS | 0%, no CDV, schema-only (subunit hierarchy unused) |

### Never-Deployed (13 fields)
Features built but never activated in PPL's deployment.
| Field | Table | Evidence |
|-------|-------|---------|
| PLAN_END | VEGUNIT | 0%, no CDV, no CDB |
| AGRENDDATE | VEGUNIT | 0%, no CDV, no CDB |
| PEREND | VEGUNIT | 0%, no CDV, no CDB |
| MITIDISCDT | VEGUNIT | 0%, no CDV, no CDB |
| MITINSPDT | VEGUNIT | 0%, no CDV, no CDB |
| INVOICE_DT | VEGUNIT | 0%, no CDV, no CDB (invoicing outside WS) |
| INVOICE_PE | VEGUNIT | 0%, no CDV, no CDB (invoicing outside WS) |
| GROUPASSIGNEDTO | SSUNITSCSTM | 0%, no CDV, no CDB (works at job level only) |
| GROUPASSIGNEDTO_USERS | SSUNITSCSTM | 0%, mirrors above |
| COPYUNITSGUID | SSUNITSCSTM | 0%, no CDV, no CDB |
| ESTUNITCOST | SSUNITSCSTM | 0.05% (58 rows), no CDV, no CDB |
| TMREASON | SSUNITSCSTM | 0.02% (27 rows), no CDV, no CDB |
| TARGETEDCOMP | SSUNITSCSTM | 0.08% (91 rows), no CDV, no CDB |

### System-Reserved (3 fields)
CDB views reference them but no process populates them.
| Field | Table | Evidence |
|-------|-------|---------|
| CREWNOTES | VEGUNIT | 0%, no CDV, IN worktoassign+worktocomplete CDB |
| PRIORITYTEXT | VEGUNIT | <0.01% (1 row), no CDV, IN worktoassign CDB |
| MANHOURS | JVU | 0%, no CDV, IN worktoassign+worktocomplete CDB |

## Developer Recommendations

### Must-Have Fields
**Chain keys:** JOBGUID, STATNAME, SEQUENCE (+UNITGUID, WO, EXT)

**SSUNITS:** UNITTYPE (100%), STATUS (100%), UNIT (100%), QUANTITY (99.8%), OBJECTID (100%), GEOMETRY (99.97%)

**VEGUNIT:** UNIT_CLASS (lifecycle, 5 values + NULL), CUSTOMSTATUS (string mirror), ASSDDATE (99.7%), DUEDATE (99.5%), DATEPOP (80.3%), NOTIFDATE (68.6%), AUDITDATE (65.3%), FORESTER (99.7%), CONTRACTOR (96.4%), CREW_DATE (33.6%), ACCDATE (31.8%), PERMSTAT (6 values), GF/GF_USER (34.9%)

**JVU:** NUMTREES (29%), ACRES (23%), AREA (22%). Quantity = `Coalesce(AREA, NUMTREES, LENGTHWRK)`

### Safe-to-Ignore
- All 4 SSUNITS engineering fields
- All 7 VEGUNIT dead date fields (PLAN_END, AGRENDDATE, PEREND, MITIDISCDT, MITINSPDT, INVOICE_DT, INVOICE_PE)
- SSUNITSCSTM custom fields (GROUPASSIGNEDTO, COPYUNITSGUID, ESTUNITCOST, TMREASON, TARGETEDCOMP) — all <0.1%
- SSUNITSCSTM table for non-Dx queries — only Dx jobs have rows

### Watch-List
- CREWNOTES, PRIORITYTEXT, MANHOURS — CDB queries SELECT them; could activate
- LASTEDITDT (0.06%) — edit tracking exists but barely used; may be future audit requirement
- PERMSTAT "No Contact" (6,909) and "Deferred" (1,638) — undocumented values not in config
- UNIT_CLASS=3 with PERMSTAT "Approved" (667 rows) — data quality gap (resolved permissions, class not updated)

### Query Patterns
Canonical 7-table join (worktoassign.cdb): `VEGUNIT → VEGSTAT → UNITS → JVU (LEFT) → SSUNITS → SS → VEGJOB`
- JVU always LEFT JOIN
- `EXT <> '@'` excludes template records
- `lengthwrk / 5280` converts feet to miles
- Never join SSUNITSCSTM (unless Dx-specific analysis)

### TALL-Stack Notes
- **UNIT_CLASS** drives pipeline views: use as filter/tab in Livewire dashboards
  - 5 values (+ NULL): 0=complete, 1=working, 2=dispatched, 3=perm exception, 4=archived
  - Values 3 and 4 are server-managed — invisible to CDB/CDV mobile forms
- **CUSTOMSTATUS** mirrors UNIT_CLASS as string: SA=2, ACTIV=1, CLOSE=4 — use either for filtering
- **SS.STATUS** (7 values): CLOSE, ACTIV, QC, SA, DEF, REWRK, REV — independent from CUSTOMSTATUS
- **Date lifecycle** (ASSDDATE→DATEPOP→NOTIFDATE→DUEDATE→ACCDATE→CREW_DATE→AUDITDATE) maps to pipeline stages — each null date = workflow gate not yet passed
- **JVU quantity** pattern: implement `Coalesce(AREA, NUMTREES, LENGTHWRK)` as Eloquent accessor
- **PERMSTAT** values (6): "Approved" (72.7%), empty (24.4%), "PPL Approved" (2.6%), "No Contact" (0.19%), "Refused" (0.11%), "Deferred" (0.04%)
- **EDITDATE** is OLE float across all 4 tables — parse with Carbon OLE helper, identical across chain (job-level, not unit-level)
- **Two-pipeline model**: Assessment (0→2→4, with 3 dead end) and Work (1→0) — design UI to reflect both flows
