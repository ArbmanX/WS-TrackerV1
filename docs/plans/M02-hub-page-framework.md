# M2: Hub Page Framework

> Depends on: M1
> Unlocks: M3, M4, M6, M10, M11

## Goal

Build reusable layout and components that all hub pages share. Every hub is a card-grid landing page with consistent structure.

## Micro Tasks

- [ ] Hub page layout template (title, optional stat cards row, card grid area)
- [ ] Reusable `<x-hub.card>` component (icon, title, summary text, metric badge, link)
- [ ] Reusable `<x-hub.stat-card>` component (label, value, trend indicator)
- [ ] Responsive grid: 2-col on desktop, 1-col on mobile
- [ ] Empty/loading states for cards
- [ ] Consistent card sizing and spacing across all hubs
