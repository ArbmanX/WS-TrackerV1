## Goal

Region page at `/assessments/region/{id}`. Overview of a single region's circuits, planners, and assessment status.

## Micro Tasks

- [ ] Region header — name, active circuit count, planner count
- [ ] Circuits list — cards per circuit with assessment count, completion %, status
- [ ] Aggregate stats — total assessments, completion %, status breakdown
- [ ] Planner distribution — which planners work this region
- [ ] Snapshot trend — historical regional performance (if snapshot data exists)
- [ ] Cross-links: circuit names → Circuit Detail, planner names → Planner Detail
