# M14: Planner Role Views

> Depends on: M1, M5
> Unlocks: none

## Goal

Tailored sidebar and hub pages for the planner role. Three hubs scoped to "my" data.

## Micro Tasks

- [ ] My Dashboard hub — personal quota gauge, coaching message, this-week stats, mini activity feed
- [ ] My Circuits hub — cards per assigned circuit with assessment counts, completion %, status badges
- [ ] My Progress hub — career trend chart, weekly miles, historical performance
- [ ] All hubs scoped to authenticated planner's data only (filter by username)
- [ ] Reuse Planner Detail view components where possible (quota gauge, career chart)
