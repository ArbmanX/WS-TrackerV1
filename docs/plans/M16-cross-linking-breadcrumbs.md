# M16: Cross-Linking & Breadcrumbs

> Depends on: M5, M7, M8, M9
> Unlocks: none

## Goal

Entity link system and breadcrumb tracking across all hubs and detail views.

## Micro Tasks

- [ ] Entity link helper — consistent URL generation for planner, circuit, assessment, region, ghost entities
- [ ] All entity names rendered as clickable links throughout the app
- [ ] Breadcrumb component — shows entry-path context (e.g., Planners → tgibson → CKT-4412)
- [ ] Breadcrumb tracking — first segment is the hub you came from, trail builds as you drill deeper
- [ ] Breadcrumb display on all detail views
- [ ] Back-to-hub link on detail views (uses breadcrumb context)
